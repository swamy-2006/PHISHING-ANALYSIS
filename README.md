This is an email recived by me, i just opened the email and in the right top i went to see orignal...
There we can see the Sender IP, domain and few more details.
From the IP address we can get the location of the service which they have sent through 
[WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com)

From there we can confirm the location of genrated email.
Also from the domain name we can do dnslookup.
